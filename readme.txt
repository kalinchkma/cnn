Batch Size: This refers to the number of training examples utilized in one iteration. Essentially, during the training process, the dataset is divided into batches, and each batch is fed into the model for computation. The batch size can significantly affect the training process, influencing factors like memory usage, convergence speed, and generalization.

Learning Rate: The learning rate determines the step size at which the model parameters are updated during training. It's a crucial hyperparameter because it directly impacts the convergence of the model. A high learning rate may cause the model to overshoot optimal solutions, while a low learning rate may lead to slow convergence or getting stuck in local minima.

Learning Rate Drop Factor: This hyperparameter is typically used in learning rate scheduling techniques like learning rate decay. After a certain number of epochs or based on specific conditions, the learning rate is reduced by a factor determined by this parameter. It helps in fine-tuning the learning process, especially in situations where initially large learning rates might lead to overshooting.

Normalization: Normalization is the process of scaling input features to a similar range. This can be important for neural networks because it helps to ensure that all input features contribute equally to the learning process, prevents gradients from becoming too large or too small, and aids in faster convergence during training.

Max Epochs: This hyperparameter specifies the maximum number of times the entire dataset is passed forward and backward through the neural network during the training process. It helps to prevent overfitting and sets an upper limit on training time.

Epoch Patience: Epoch patience is often used in conjunction with techniques like early stopping. It represents the number of epochs to wait before considering an improvement in the model's performance. If the performance metric (e.g., validation loss) doesn't improve for this number of epochs, training may be stopped or other actions, such as reducing the learning rate, may be taken.

Early Stopping: Early stopping is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting. It stops the training process when the performance of the model on a validation dataset starts to degrade, indicating that further training may not lead to better generalization. This is typically based on a predefined criterion, such as no improvement in validation loss for a certain number of epochs (determined by epoch patience).

Optimizer: The optimizer is an algorithm used to update the model parameters during training in order to minimize the loss function. Examples include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, etc. Each optimizer has its own set of hyperparameters (e.g., momentum, decay rates) that can be tuned to improve training performance and convergence speed.
